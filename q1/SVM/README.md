For kernel_trick question, I used different kernels like 
1
x+y
y^2-4x
x^2+y^2

The data was made linearly seperable only in the last case.

For letter_classification, I ran my code for the following combinations : -

i. Kernel = “poly” with degrees [1,2,3] , “linear”, “rbf”
ii. C = [0.1, 1, 10, 100]
Iii. gamma = [0.1, 1, 10, 100]
